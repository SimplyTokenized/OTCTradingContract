# OTC Trading Contract

An upgradeable on-chain **Over-The-Counter (OTC)** trading contract for ERC-20 tokens. Makers post fixed-price BUY or SELL orders; takers fill them partially or fully. The contract supports configurable maker/taker fees, an optional trading whitelist, multiple counterparty tokens (including native ETH), and order expiration.

> **Status:** Pre-production. This code has undergone an internal security review (see [Security](#-security)) but **has not been audited by an independent third party**. Do not deploy to mainnet with real funds until an external audit has been completed. See [DISCLAIMER](#-disclaimer).

## ✨ Features

- **Upgradeable** — OpenZeppelin transparent proxy pattern (UUPS-free, `ProxyAdmin`-controlled).
- **BUY and SELL orders** — makers can bid for the base token or offer it for sale.
- **Multiple counterparty tokens** — any admin-approved ERC-20, plus native **ETH** (`address(0)`).
- **Configurable fees** — independent maker and taker fees in basis points, capped at 10% each. Fee rates are **snapshotted per order** at creation, so later fee changes never apply retroactively.
- **Optional whitelist** — restrict trading to approved addresses.
- **Order expiration** — optional per-deployment default expiry.
- **Partial fills** — orders can be filled incrementally.
- **Pausable** — admin can halt trading.
- **Role-based access control** — separate admin and fee-recipient roles.
- **Reentrancy-protected** — all state-changing external functions use `nonReentrant`, and settlement uses `SafeERC20`.

> ⚠️ **Fee-on-transfer / rebasing tokens are not supported.** The accounting assumes the contract receives exactly the amount transferred. Do not approve such tokens as base or counterparty tokens.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is deployed behind an OpenZeppelin **transparent proxy**:

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Proxy** | The stable address users interact with; holds all state. |
| **Implementation** (`OTCTrading`) | Trading logic; contains no persistent state of its own. |
| **ProxyAdmin** | A separate contract that performs upgrades. Its **owner** is the `ADMIN` address supplied at deploy time. |

Upgrades are authorized by the **ProxyAdmin owner** — this is independent from the contract's internal `AccessControl` roles. See [Roles & Trust Model](#-roles--trust-model).

Solidity `0.8.27`, built with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), `via-IR` enabled, OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.

## 📋 Trading Parameters

Deploy-time defaults (configurable in [`script/DeployOTC.s.sol`](script/DeployOTC.s.sol)):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Maker fee | 25 bps (0.25%) | Charged on the counterparty amount. Max 1000 bps. |
| Taker fee | 50 bps (0.50%) | Charged on the counterparty amount. Max 1000 bps. |
| Minimum order size | 100 | Minimum base-token amount per order (must be > 0). |
| Maximum order size | 0 | Upper bound on base-token amount (`0` = no limit). |
| Default order expiration | 0 | Seconds until orders expire (`0` = never). |
| Require whitelist | true | Whether traders must be whitelisted. |

## 📦 Order Model

An order is created with an explicit **type**:

- **`SELL` (enum value `1`)** — the maker deposits `baseTokenAmount` of the base token and wants counterparty tokens in return. The taker supplies the counterparty token and receives base tokens.
- **`BUY` (enum value `0`)** — the maker deposits `counterpartyTokenAmount` of the counterparty token (or ETH) and wants base tokens. The taker supplies base tokens and receives the counterparty token.

The price is fixed at creation as the ratio `counterpartyTokenAmount / baseTokenAmount`. Fills are settled proportionally and any dust that rounds the counterparty amount to zero is rejected.

## 💰 Fee Model

Both fees are computed on the **counterparty amount** of each fill, using the rates **snapshotted into the order at creation**.

**SELL order** (taker pays the fee on top; maker pays it out of proceeds):

```
taker pays        = counterpartyAmount + takerFee
maker receives    = counterpartyAmount − makerFee
fee recipient     = makerFee + takerFee
```

**BUY order** (mirror of SELL: the maker pre-funds the maker fee at creation, the taker's fee is deducted from proceeds):

```
maker deposits    = counterpartyAmount + makerFee
taker receives    = counterpartyAmount − takerFee
fee recipient     = makerFee + takerFee
```

The fee incidence follows the maker/taker role in both directions: the order creator (maker) always bears the maker fee, and the filler (taker) always bears the taker fee. On cancellation or cleanup, the unfilled portion of the deposit — including the still-unused maker fee — is refunded to the maker.

**Worked example — SELL 1000 BASE for 2000 USDC, fully filled (25/50 bps):**

| Party | Amount |
|-------|--------|
| Taker pays | 2010 USDC |
| Maker receives | 1995 USDC |
| Fee recipient | 15 USDC |

## 🔐 Roles & Trust Model

| Role | Powers |
|------|--------|
| **ProxyAdmin owner** | Upgrade the implementation contract. Set to the `ADMIN` address at deploy. |
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Grant/revoke roles. |
| `ADMIN_ROLE` | Manage fees, order limits, whitelist, counterparty tokens, pause/unpause, cleanup, and **emergency withdrawal**. |
| `FEE_RECIPIENT_ROLE` | Informational marker for the configured fee recipient. |

> **⚠️ Centralization notice.** An `ADMIN_ROLE` holder can pause trading and, **while the contract is paused**, call `emergencyWithdraw` to move any token or ETH out of the contract — including funds backing open orders. The ProxyAdmin owner can additionally replace the entire implementation. **These are powerful, trust-critical capabilities.**
>
> For production you should:
> - Assign the ProxyAdmin owner and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`/`ADMIN_ROLE` to a **multisig** and/or a **timelock**, not a single EOA. The default deploy script assigns all of them to one `ADMIN` address — change this before mainnet.
> - Publish the custody arrangement so users can assess counterparty risk.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (`forge`, `cast`, `anvil`)
- Node.js ≥ 18 (only for the npm convenience scripts)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimplyTokenized/OTCTradingContract.git
cd OTCTradingContract
forge install        # pulls submodules in lib/
```

### Build & test

```bash
forge build
forge test            # 89 tests
forge test --gas-report
forge coverage        # optional
```

### Configure

Copy the template and fill in real addresses:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env
```

`.env` is git-ignored and must never be committed. Never place private keys in `.env` for public networks — pass them via `--account`/keystore or a hardware signer at deploy time.

## 📤 Deployment

The deploy script reads `BASE_TOKEN`, `DEFAULT_COUNTERPARTY_TOKEN`, `FEE_RECIPIENT`, and `ADMIN` from the environment and deploys the implementation, a `ProxyAdmin`, and the transparent proxy, initializing it atomically.

```bash
# Local (Anvil) — uses the well-known public Anvil key, LOCAL USE ONLY
npm run deploy:local

# Testnet (recommended: sign with a keystore account, not a raw key)
forge script script/DeployOTC.s.sol:DeployOTC \
  --rpc-url "$TESTNET_RPC" \
  --account deployer \
  --sender "$DEPLOYER" \
  --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key "$ETHERSCAN_API_KEY"
```

After deploying, **use the proxy address** for all interactions. See [`CAST_COMMANDS.md`](CAST_COMMANDS.md) for ready-to-use `cast` snippets.

### Deployed addresses

| Network | Proxy | Implementation | ProxyAdmin |
|---------|-------|----------------|------------|
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

## 📖 Contract API

### Trading

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `createOrder(OrderType orderType, address counterpartyToken, uint256 baseTokenAmount, uint256 counterpartyTokenAmount)` `payable` → `uint256 orderId` | Create a BUY or SELL order. For a SELL, `baseTokenAmount` of the base token is pulled from the maker. For a BUY, `counterpartyTokenAmount + makerFee` of the counterparty token is pulled (or must be sent as `msg.value` when the counterparty is ETH). |
| `fillOrder(uint256 orderId, uint256 baseTokenAmount)` `payable` | Fill an order partially or fully. |
| `cancelOrder(uint256 orderId)` | Cancel your own order and reclaim the unfilled remainder. |
| `batchCancelOrders(uint256[] orderIds)` | Cancel multiple of your own orders. |

### Admin (`ADMIN_ROLE`)

`addCounterpartyToken` · `removeCounterpartyToken` · `updateFees` · `updateFeeRecipient` · `updateMinOrderSize` · `updateMaxOrderSize` · `updateDefaultOrderExpiration` · `updateWhitelistRequirement` · `addToWhitelist` · `removeFromWhitelist` · `batchAddToWhitelist` · `batchRemoveFromWhitelist` · `cleanupExpiredOrders` · `pause` · `unpause` · `emergencyWithdraw` *(only while paused)*

### Views

`getOrder` · `getUserOrders` · `getRemainingAmount` · `isOrderExpired` · `getActiveOrders(offset, limit)` · `getOrdersByToken(token, offset, limit)` · plus the public getters `orders`, `nextOrderId`, `makerFeeBps`, `takerFeeBps`, `minOrderSize`, `maxOrderSize`, `requireWhitelist`, `defaultOrderExpiration`, `baseToken`, `feeRecipient`, `allowedCounterpartyTokens`, `whitelist`.

### Events

`OrderCreated` · `OrderFilled` · `OrderCancelled` · `CounterpartyTokenAdded` · `CounterpartyTokenRemoved` · `WhitelistAdded` · `WhitelistRemoved` · `FeesUpdated` · `MinOrderSizeUpdated` · `MaxOrderSizeUpdated` · `DefaultOrderExpirationUpdated` · `WhitelistRequirementUpdated` · `FeeRecipientUpdated` · `OrdersCleanedUp` · `EmergencyWithdrawal`

Full NatSpec-generated reference: `npm run docgen` (see [Documentation](#-documentation)).

### Upgrading

```solidity
// Executed by the ProxyAdmin owner
Upgrades.upgradeProxy(proxyAddress, "OTCTradingV2.sol", "");
```

Run `Upgrades.validateUpgrade` (or `forge` with the OpenZeppelin upgrades plugin) before every upgrade to catch storage-layout incompatibilities.

## 🛡️ Security

- All trading entry points are `nonReentrant`; token transfers use `SafeERC20`; ETH transfers use checked low-level calls.
- Fee rates are snapshotted per order and cannot be changed retroactively.
- Fills that round the counterparty amount to zero are rejected.
- `emergencyWithdraw` is gated behind `whenPaused`, so any withdrawal is preceded by a visible on-chain pause.

An internal review and its remediations are documented alongside this repository. **No independent external audit has been performed yet** — commission one before mainnet deployment.

To report a vulnerability, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Please do not open public issues for security reports.
